          fourd.cpp is a rewrite of the below mentioned fourd.js, in C++, ported to web assembly. It doesn't have the multilevel part built in, yet, but that will be a weekend project in the near future.</p>

          The best way to describe <a href="https://social-cartography.github.io/social-cartography">Social Cartography</a> at the moment is as an advanced family tree maker. I hope this application will find its way into journalism and education.

          The fourd.js (<a href="https://thwee-alchemist.github.io/fourd.js/lib/">live</a>/<a href="https://github.com/thwee-alchemist/fourd.js">code</a>) project aims to provide a dynamic 3D graph visualization in the browser, where it can easily interact with other web applications. The name is a pun on the included dimension of time that can be represented with a dynamic vs a static graph.

          This little chess board (<a href="https://thwee-alchemist.github.io/chess">live</a>/<a href="https://github.com/thwee-alchemist/chess">code</a>) is not broken. After inventing several alternative chess games with a friend, I wanted a piece of code that would allow me to set up the chess peaces as I pleased. Perhaps a little antiquated, this board works for two players sharing a mouse. Now with touch! <a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">Thanks!</a>.
