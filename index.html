    <div id="story">Hi. Are you looking for a software engineer? I am once again looking for work. I concern myself with graphs. Most things, including code and social networks are often better represented as graphs than as lists.
      
      Here are some of my accomplishments, find more at <a href="https://code.joshuamoore.dev">code.joshuamoore.dev</a>

          (<a href="https://leudla.herokuapp.com">live</a>/<a href="https://github.com/thwee-alchemist/leudla.herokuapp.com">code</a>) End to end encrypted communications written in Javascript, thanks to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/subtle">crypto.subtle</a>. Through the UI, one creates a public/private key pair, then submits it to server. After selecting a recipient and typing a message, the sender and recipients' private and public keys (respectively) are used to derive a shared key, which is used to encrypt the message for transit. The recipient uses the sender's public key, and their own private key to rederive the shared key and decrypt the message. The server uses <a href="https://expressjs.com">express.js</a> and <a href="https://socket.io">socket.io</a>.

It represents a compromise between my Math skill, and the desire to get this product out the door. Using this custom element, you can display graphs on your webpage.

          <img src="SocialCartography.png" />
          <a href="https://social-cartography.github.io/social-cartography">Social Cartography</a> is a prototype for a tool for visually displaying social hierarchies. It works by entering pairs of subentities and superentities, in the form sub@super. Repeat this process, double click the labels to change pictures, and watch the graph grow as you enter information.

          This is a free online version of a chess board (<a href="http://thwee-chess.herokuapp.com/">live</a>), no registration required. Simply enter a unique name in the top bar and have your partner enter the same name. Now you two are connected, and can see each other move the pieces. Written with expressjs and socket.io, and hosted on heroku.
