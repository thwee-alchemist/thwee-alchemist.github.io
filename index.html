          The fourd.js (<a href="https://thwee-alchemist.github.io/fourd.js/lib/">live</a>/<a href="https://github.com/thwee-alchemist/fourd.js">code</a>) project aims to provide a dynamic 3D graph visualization in the browser, where it can easily interact with other web applications. The name is a pun on the included dimension of time that can be represented with a dynamic vs a static graph.

          This little chess board (<a href="https://thwee-alchemist.github.io/chess">live</a>/<a href="https://github.com/thwee-alchemist/chess">code</a>) is not broken. After inventing several alternative chess games with a friend, I wanted a piece of code that would allow me to set up the chess peaces as I pleased. Perhaps a little antiquated, this board works for two players sharing a mouse. Now with touch! <a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">Thanks!</a>.
